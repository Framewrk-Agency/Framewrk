Entrepreneurs are boxed in, they're trapped, they’ve been told to live in four distinct walls. The walls of business models, customers, teams, and competition. And on the outside of these four walls are dreams; staring at entrepreneurs, looking at them, waiting for them to break the fourth wall and engage with them, to invite the audience of their dreams onto the stage and experience greatness.

But why does this problem even exist? Because for years entrepreneurs have been told, taught, and professed what to think. They've been trapped within the four walls and never shown how to think. It's a shame because there’s never been another time with so much information: we have generations of innovation, stories, thoughts, leaders, and classes that there should be mental frameworks for how to think and more importantly how to think about thinking.
But there isn’t. We keep doing the same old things living in the same four walls.
